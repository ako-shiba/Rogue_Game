# Rogue_Game
This is my reimagining of the original 'Rogue'â€”the game that laid the foundation for all roguelikes. They say there's no point in reinventing the wheel, but I believe there is, especially when innovation takes it somewhere new.

Its a simple game that can be played an IDE or in your CMD! 

Characters:
@ - Player
! - Enemy
# - Crate
. - Floor


If you don't have an IDE you can play it in CMD:

Simply Press (Windows Key + R) or Search for CMD.
After downloading the "Rogue_Game" file, Right click said file and click "Copy As Path". 

Then in your CMD, type: javac
Followed by CTRL + V of the file location

Then, type: java
Followed by CTRL + V again

and bam, the game is now running!
